## Self Evaluation on Arrays Practice

1. I feel confident with arrays, as i've had a lot of practice with them using python
1. We unfortunately missed the lesson on Github, so the upload/download process is still a bit awkward
1. No questions on arrays at this point, but im sure something will come as time progresses
